# Time Blocking

Just some productivity method I saw on youtube. Actually used a self-created version of this during uni days, but somehow dropped it over time. Recently feels like less time for 'deep work' or more creative stuff so gonna explore more things like this.

This method is basically planning or scheduling your work day in advance. Most insane people like Musk/Gates use a variation of this with different levels of insanity. I like Cal Newport's style:
- He spends 10-20 minutes each day to block out his day in 30 minute chunks. 
- Estimate how much time is needed for each task ('important' things like work projects), OR assign how much time you want to work on a certain task (Flexible things like personal projects, readings etc).
- Leave time for reactive work such as answering mails/messages
- Mainly so that you can dedicate time for deep efforts required for creative work.

Three main advantages I hope to gain from this would be: 1. decrease transition time as you shift from 1 task to the other. 2. More sequential time periods that increase effectiveness of deep work. 3. Decrease time spent on decision making for what task to work on, compressing them to the 10-20 min planning period.

Key failure points:
- Improper estimation of task duration, we always over-estimate ourselves
- Reactive sitiations are nearly unavoidable if you work in an office or typical workplace.
- Inability to follow through with plans due to rigidity or burnout.
